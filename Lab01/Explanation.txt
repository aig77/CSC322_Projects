  wc `grep -l int *` is an example of command substitution, or running a command
  within a command. Using command1 `command2` in place of the actual commands,
  this means that command2 will be executed and will feed the output into the
  input of command1.
  Using this method, the output of command2 is added as an argument to command1.
  This is because the commands run on every individual
  file in the directory and pull wordcounts from every file and subdirectory.

  grep -l int * | wc is an example of pipelining. Using command1 | command2 in
  place of the actual commands written, this means when command1 and command2 are
  executed the standard outpud of command1 is fed into the standard input of
  command2.
  Using this method, the output of command1 is fed into the standard input of
  command2. This is because it will run only within that directory.
