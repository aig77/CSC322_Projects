Grep pattern to find all proper java int variable declarations in GreExInts.txt
Rules:
    * Must be an int (no other variable types)
    * int <-- must be written this way (not Int, integer, iNT, etc)
    * indentation before variable type does not matter
    * must have at least one space after variable type
    * space between variable type and variable name does not matter
    * variable must start with letter (lowercase or captial), $, or  _
    * variable name cannot contain reserved characters (#, !, ?, etc)
      full list in Oracle documentation
    * commented variables are not declared (do not count)
    * comments after a declaration are ok
    * spacing between two variable names (seperated by comma) in one line does not
      matter
    * must end with a semicolon
    * spacing between variable name(s) and semicolon does not matter

Explanation: start with any number of space (remove comments), contain int
(written this way), at least one space after, first character must be approved
character, cannot contain resereved characters, ends with semicolon (doesn't
have to be end of the line)
