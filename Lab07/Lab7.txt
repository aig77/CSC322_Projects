Write a program to display all comments in a C program. The program is typed in at the keyboard,
and the output displayed on the screen. It can also be tested on files by redirecting the standard
input. Don't forget to handle quoted strings properly. Furthermore, only comments that start with
/* and end with */ need to be accounted for.
