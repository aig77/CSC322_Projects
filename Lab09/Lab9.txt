Since we talked about pointers and arrays in class, I'd like you to write a program that allows the user to:

input integers to a 3 x 3 matrix from the stdin,
input integers to another 3 x 3 matrix from the stdin,
multiply these matrices,
store the product in a third matrix
and output the result in a formatted (i.e. 3 x 3) way to the stdout.

You must

implement the program in C,
using pointers to carry out the array manipulations,
creating subfunctions for the input, multiplication and output of the matrices
and (to make it fun) you need not use any [] when you deal with pointers to array entries (5.0%).
